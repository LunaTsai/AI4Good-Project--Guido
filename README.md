# AI4Good-Project--Guido
For our final team project at the summer Machine Learning Program @ AI4Good Lab, we created an app called **Guido**, which **assists the visually impaired with crossing intersections by informing them of relevant details**. My contribution to this project was to fine-tune a **ResNet CNN** model using satellite images of different intersection road types (T, Cross, Offset) and deploy the tuned model with a **RESTful API** to our app. This allows the visually impaired to identify the type of intersection they are facing, helping them navigate more safely before crossing.
